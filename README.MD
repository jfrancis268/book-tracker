# Book Tracker

## Description
This app is intended for users who want to keep track of their reading goals using a simple-to-use interface. Features include searching for a book by title and adding books to the user's "My Library", where it can be drag and dropped into one of three sections: Already Read, Currently Reading, or Want to Read. This app is perfect for bookworms and average readers alike, who like to keep tabs on their reading progress.
